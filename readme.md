QUESTION 1:

step 1 -  install web3 and dotenv

import web3 , the alchemy provider and dotenv into index.js

step 2 -  Go to etherscan and get a contrac address and wallet address

step 3 -  wrtie up the binary application interface

step 4 create a function that will return the balance of the wallet address


NOTE: This particular implementation isn't working because the contract is not deployed to the network. I don't have much time to debug it, so I'm just going to leave it here for now.

QUESTION 2:

The first step i'd take is to ask the customer to send a copy of the transaction , describe the services they are trying to purchase and what they are paying for. After checking to make sure there was an error, i would ask the customer if they'd like a refund or exchange.


QUESTION 3:

I would explain to the customer that they can't use the service as they misrepresented the service they are trying to purchase. I would get a clear picture of what the service is and migrate them to the service they want.
